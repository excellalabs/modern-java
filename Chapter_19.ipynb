For many Java purposes, restrictions on Java 8 streams such as no recursive definitions are unproblematic and give your database-like queries expressivity and the ability to parallelize. Thus, the Java 8 designers chose a sweet spot. Nonetheless, the more general features and models of streams from functional languages such as Scala and Haskell can be useful additions to your programming toolbox. What you need is a way to lazily evaluate the call to the method.\n",

(In a more technical programming vocabulary, we refer to this concept as lazy evaluation, nonstrict evaluation or even call by name.)

    "- First-class functions are functions that can be passed as arguments, returned as results, and stored in data structures.\n",

    "- Currying is a technique that lets you modularize functions and reuse code.\n",
    "- A persistent data structure preserves the previous version of itself when it’s modified. As a result, it can prevent unnecessary defensive copying.  Streams in Java can’t be self-defined.\n",
    "- A lazy list is a more-expressive version of a Java stream. A lazy list lets you produce elements of the list on demand by using a supplier that can create more of the data structure.\n",
